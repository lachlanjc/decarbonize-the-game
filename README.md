# Decarbonize: The Game

If you’re encountering this on GitHub, welcome! This is the software component of a work-in-progress hardware & software board game over which you grow & decarbonize the US electricity grid while trying to keep carbon emissions & energy prices down.

If you’d like to play without the pieces, go ahead! <https://decarbonize-the-game.vercel.app/> Press a/s/d/f on your keyboard to buy the energy sources in the bottom dock. The camera usage is to scan barcodes on the game pieces instead of the keyboard.

Made with Next.js 13, Tailwind CSS, Recharts, and quagga2.
