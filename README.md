# Decarbonize: The Game

If you’re encountering this on GitHub, welcome! This is the software component of a work-in-progress hardware & software board game over which you grow & decarbonize the US electricity grid while trying to keep carbon emissions & energy prices down.

Read progress updates here: <https://edu.lachlanjc.com/2022-11-29_pcomp_final_project>

If you’d like to play without the pieces, go ahead! <https://decarbonize-the-game.vercel.app/> Use keyboard shortcuts instead of the camera scanning to purchase additional energy sources: <kbd>a</kbd> (solar), <kbd>s</kbd> (wind), <kbd>d</kbd> (coal), <kbd>f</kbd> (gas). The camera usage is to scan barcodes on the game pieces.

Made with Next.js 13, Tailwind CSS, Recharts, and [quagga2](https://github.com/ericblade/quagga2).
